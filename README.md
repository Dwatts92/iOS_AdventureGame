AdventureGame_CSE494
====================
For information on the game, there is an About.txt file in the Supporting Files folder that you can check out while running the project. The main game progression logic can be found in the MainScreen.m file done with button checks.

Possible Tasks:
1) Add persistent game Stats to a new view linked to the Status table view. This could have things like time played, how many characters made, how many attacks or blocks you've done, etc.
2) An arena unlocked after beating the game where the user can enter constant combat scenarios for fun.
3) Sound effects for buttons, combat hits and blocks, etc.


PROJECT 2:

Parse credentials:

All saving and loading is done through Parse with the Character object under AdventureGame.

Hitting Continue will load the most recent character's playtrough, hitting Load Game will load any saved character, most recent listed at the top. All saving and loading is done through Parse with the Character object under AdventureGame. Beating the game will earn you the arena, where you can fight and level up forever. You can load up 'ArenaFight' to skip straight to this. Also in status screen you can Exit back to main menu to load new characters without exiting the game, and the new Game Stats are there as well.

I believe I have accomplished all my goals listed. Sincerest apologies for the lateness. If you run into any issues when first playing, please reset your emulator settings. Any other issues please contact me at my email, I tested this quite thourghly.

The warning "Automatic Preferred Max Warning.." may come up, this does nothing and is related to running on brand new Xcode/iOS.

Credit goes to Todd Cunniham (tcunningham7 on github) for all the button sounds which were added in assignment 5!

Thank you for grading this and have a fantastic winter break! :)
