AdventureGame_CSE494
====================
For information on the game, there is an About.txt file in the Supporting Files folder that you can check out while running the project. I will be adding better commenting on Friday, but the main game progression logic is in the the MainScreen.m file done with button checks.

Possible Tasks:
1) Add persistent game Stats to a new view linked to the Status table view. This could have things like time played, how many characters made, how many attacks or blocks you've done, etc.
2) An arena unlocked after beating the game where the user can enter constant combat scenarios for fun.
3) Sound effects for buttons, combat hits and blocks, etc.
